## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I stregthened what I learned from the first challenge, mainly on how to position elements correctly. I also learned to use `:hover` and `:focus` properties on CSS.

I am still looking for a way to reduce font size for smaller screens without using media queries.

### Continued development

To do next:
- Find a way to reduce font size for smaller screens without using media queries.
- The gap between the main illustration image and the card container is slightly different between left and right. Find out why and fix it.
